Once you have successfully run a simulation, use your python skills to answer to analyze the simulation results
1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate,  reproductive rate):
The inputs we gave the simulation were:
- virus
- reproduction rate 
- mortality rate 
- population size 
- vaccination percentage 
- people initially infected. 

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

During round 3 20% of the population was infected.

3.  What percentage of the population died from the virus?

The virus wiped out 16% of the total population.

4.  Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?

Over 20,000 times a vaccination saved somebodies life.
